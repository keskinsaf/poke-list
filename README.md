This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting application

First, you should install required dependencies. So, run `npm install`
or `yarn install` before moving ahead.

### `npm start`

With this command, application can be run in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### IMPORTANT NOTE:

Due to time limitations, I could only had half a day to complete this
task. So, it has many missing parts, like dockerization, testing,
documentation etc. So, I am sorry. I am not satisfied with my own project
but I should submit that at the moment, because I will not have time
tomorrow, neither and I want to come to you with something in my hands.
